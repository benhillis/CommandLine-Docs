The commands `bash.exe` and `lxrun.exe` are used to interact with the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).  These commands are installed into the \Windows\System32 directory and may be run within a Windows command prompt or in PowerShell.

* `bash.exe` launches the Bash environment and invokes /bin/bash.
* `lxrun.exe` is used to manage WSL.  This command can be used to install or uninstall the Ubuntu image.
